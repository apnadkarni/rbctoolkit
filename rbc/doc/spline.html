Fit curves with spline interpolation</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>spline
natural</b> <i>x y sx sy</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>spline
    quadratic</b> <i>x y sx sy</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>spline</b> command computes a spline fitting a set of
data points (x and y vectors) and produces a vector of the
interpolated images (y-coordinates) at a given set of
x-coordinates.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Curve fitting
has many applications. In graphs, curve fitting can be
useful for displaying curves which are aesthetically
pleasing to the eye. Another advantage is that you can
quickly generate arbitrary points on the curve from a small
set of data points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A spline is a
device used in drafting to produce smoothed curves. The
points of the curve, known as <i>knots</i>, are fixed and
the <i>spline</i>, typically a thin strip of wood or metal,
is bent around the knots to create the smoothed curve.
Spline interpolation is the mathematical equivalent. The
curves between adjacent knots are piecewise functions such
that the resulting spline runs exactly through all the
knots. The order and coefficients of the polynominal
determine the &quot;looseness&quot; or &quot;tightness&quot;
of the curve fit from the line segments formed by the
knots.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>spline</b> command performs spline interpolation using
cubic (&quot;natural&quot;) or quadratic polynomial
functions. It computes the spline based upon the knots,
which are given as x and y vectors. The interpolated new
points are determined by another vector which represents the
abscissas (x-coordinates) or the new points. The ordinates
(y-coordinates) are interpolated using the spline and
written to another vector.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before we can
use the <b>spline</b> command, we need to create two BLT
vectors which will represent the knots (x and y coordinates)
of the data that we&rsquo;re going to fit. Obviously, both
vectors must be the same length.</p>
<pre style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"># Create sample data of ten points.
vector x(10) y(10)


for {set i 10} {$i &gt; 0} {incr i -1} {
    set x($i-1) [expr $i*$i]
    set y($i-1) [expr sin($i*$i*$i)]
}</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We now have two
vectors <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> representing the ten data
points we&rsquo;re trying to fit. The order of the values of
<tt>x</tt> must be monotonically increasing. We can use the
vector&rsquo;s <b>sort</b> operation to sort the
vectors.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">x sort y</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The components
of <tt>x</tt> are sorted in increasing order. The components
of <tt>y</tt> are rearranged so that the original x,y
coordinate pairings are retained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A third vector
is needed to indicate the abscissas (x-coordinates) of the
new points to be interpolated by the spline. Like the x
vector, the vector of abscissas must be monotonically
increasing. All the abscissas must lie between the first and
last knots (x vector) forming the spline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How the
abscissas are picked is arbitrary. But if we are going to
plot the spline, we will want to include the knots too.
Since both the quadratic and natural splines preserve the
knots (an abscissa from the x vector will always produce the
corresponding ordinate from the y vector), we can simply
make the new vector a superset of <tt>x</tt>. It will
contain the same coordinates as <tt>x</tt>, but also the
abscissas of the new points we want interpolated. A simple
way is to use the vector&rsquo;s <b>populate</b>
operation.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">x populate sx 10</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
new vector <tt>sx</tt>. It contains the abscissas of
<tt>x</tt>, but in addition <tt>sx</tt> will have ten evenly
distributed values between each abscissa. You can
interpolate any points you wish, simply by setting the
vector values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, we
generate the ordinates (the images of the spline) using the
<b>spline</b> command. The ordinates are stored in a fourth
vector.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">spline natural x y sx sy</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
new vector <tt>sy</tt>. It will have the same length as
<tt>sx</tt>. The vectors <tt>sx</tt> and <tt>sy</tt>
represent the smoothed curve which we can now plot.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">graph .graph

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>natural</b> operation employs a cubic interpolant when
forming the spline. In terms of the draftmen&rsquo;s spline,
a <i>natural spline</i> requires the least amount of energy
to bend the spline (strip of wood), while still passing
through each knot. In mathematical terms, the second
derivatives of the first and last points are zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can generate a spline using the <b>quadratic</b>
operation. Quadratic interpolation produces a spline which
follows the line segments of the data points much more
closely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Computes a cubic spline from
the data points represented by the vectors <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> and interpolates new points using vector <i>sx</i>

written to a new vector <i>sy</i>. The vectors <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> must be the same length and contain at least three

component of <i>sx</i> can be less than first component of
<i>x</i> or greater than the last component. The order of
